### Crowdfunding an open source proyect
Maintaining an open source project has a cost. 
It requires a lot of dedication and coding hours that you do because your passion. 
:heart_eyes: It is amazing when you start receiving attention from other developers, the community or companies usinig your project. 
Then they find bugs or start suggesting new cool features that enjoy developing.

With repofunding you can ask the community for the support needed to keep your projects updated and continue improving them.

# How I can request crowdfunding for an issue
You can ask repofunding to support your issue by posting `@repofunding support donate_id` on your comments.

:warning: Anyone can reference @repofunding on an issue but only the repository owner can enable it!

:raising_hand: Currently @repofunding only works with **Paypal.ME**. The donation buttons will be generated using the `donate_id` pass to @repofunding. 

Example: [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/support-$1-lightgray.svg)](https://www.paypal.me/donate_id/1)   will point to **https://www.paypal.me/donate_id/1**
