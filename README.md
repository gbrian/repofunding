# repofunding
*The Blockchain-Crowdfunding for your repositories*

Enable crowdfunding on your repositories with repofunding and convert your issues in assets.

## Crowdfunding an open source proyect
Maintaining an open source project is not free. It requires a lot of dedication and coding hours. It is amazing when you start receiving attention from other developers, the community or companies trying your project. They find bugs or suggest new features that you have to  manage.

## Issues as assets
With repofunding you can estimate the cost of any issue and request crowdfunding for it. Anyone can then pay partial or complete to get it done.

## Safe for the funders
No charge is done until the whole amount for an asset is reached, then a payment block is executed on all funders with a timeout, after this time is automatcally released if the asset was not delivered.

## Reputation
There is only one way to get funders: reputation. Be honest, deliver on time and earn badges from your funders. Funders trust funders.

### Voting
Repo managers and funders are scored by the community
